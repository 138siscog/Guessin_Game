# Number Guessing Game

A Python console game where you try to guess a random number between 1 and 100.  
Logic is abstracted into a separate module for cleaner code organization.

---

## Description

This project demonstrates:  
- Generating random numbers with the `random` module  
- Separating logic into its own function (`check_logic`) in `logic.py`  
- Game loops and user input  
- Conditional feedback (“Too low!”, “Too high!”, “You guessed it!”)  
- Exiting cleanly once the correct number is guessed
