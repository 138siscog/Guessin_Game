# Number Guessing Game

A simple Python console game where the program picks a random number between 1 and 100 and you try to guess it.

## Description

This script demonstrates:

- Generating random numbers with the `random` module  
- Basic game loops and user input  
- Conditional logic to give feedback (“Too low!”, “Too high!”)  
- Clean exit once the correct number is guessed  

It’s Day 3 of my Python roadmap, reinforcing loops, conditionals, and standard library usage. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
